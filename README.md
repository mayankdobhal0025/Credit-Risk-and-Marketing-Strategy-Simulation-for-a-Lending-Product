# Credit Risk & Marketing Strategy Simulation Dashboard

This project builds a **credit risk prediction model** for a lending product, segments customers for targeted marketing, and simulates approval policies to balance risk and business growth. The dashboard enables interactive exploration of model performance and segment-level insights.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

- **Problem:** Financial institutions struggle to minimise loan defaults while maximising customer acquisition.  
- **Goal:** Predict high-risk applicants, segment customers by income, credit, and loan type, and simulate approval policies for strategic decision-making.
